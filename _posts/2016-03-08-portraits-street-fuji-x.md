  Thanks for being here. I'm a wedding and lifestyle photographer. My approach
  is journalistic and unscripted, which means I document people with
  authenticity as well as creativity. You can view my work at waynela.com. Where
  you are now is a collection from some of my personal work - experimental if
  you like. It combines my love of street photography with the stylised freedom
  of creative portraiture. I hope you like it. This website is built using the
  beta version of #thegrid. I can be contacted at hello (@) waynela.com
