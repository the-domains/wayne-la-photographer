description: "Thanks for being here. I'm a wedding and lifestyle photographer which means I document people with authenticity and creatively. You can view my work here.This portfolio shows a more personal approach - experimental if you like. It combines my love of street photography with the stylised freedom of creative portraiture, and some of the leftfield captures from my wedding reportage. I hope you like it.
